# Term Limits for Congress

SECTION 1. Each member of the House of Representatives and the Senate shall serve one term. No person shall henceforth serve more than one term in either chamber. No person, having served one or more terms in Congress, shall be eligible for election or appointment to either chamber henceforth.

SECTION 2. All members of the House of Representatives and of the Senate at the ratification of this amendment shall be ineligible for reelection.

SECTION 3. Members of the House of Representatives and of the Senate who are appointed rather than elected to complete the term of a member who resigns, dies or otherwise vacates his office prematurely shall not be eligible for election or appointment to either chamber at the completion of the term.

**Justification:** A term-limited citizen legislature would better reflect and be more responsive to the people that they represent. Every election cycle would replace 100% of the House and 1/3rd of the Senate with new people. This will make Congress consist of people who are actually responding to the issues of the day and the mood of the people. It will also force Congressmen/Senators to represent their constituents/state, not push their own personal agendas. 

**Comparison to Other Proposals:** Most other term-limits proposals allow for multiple terms. For example, Mark Levin's proposal allows for 12 years of service. (_The Liberty Amendments_, chapter 2.) I choose a single term for several reasons:

* Multiple-term limits still allow career politicians to build their resumes upon service in Congress. 

* Incumbents have a proven advantage over non-incumbents every election cycle. The way to eliminate this is to eliminate incumbency.

* Single-term limits force both major parties to fight for every seat, every cycle. This will have a profound effect on how both parties strategize and use resources. Multiple-term limits, especially those as long as Levin proposes, will not force the parties to change political strategy.

* Lack of incumbents opens the door wider for independents and minor-party candidates.

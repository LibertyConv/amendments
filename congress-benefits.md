# Benefits of Service in Congress

An amendment to reform the benefits that are provided to members of Congress.

SECTION 1. SALARY. Each member of the House of Representatives and of the Senate shall receive a salary equal to the median salary of all full-time Americans. This salary shall be paid quarterly. This salary shall not be paid to all members of any chamber until the chamber passes a federal budget for that calendar year. The members of any chamber that refuses to pass a federal budget during their term will forfeit their salary.

SECTION 2. BENEFITS AFTER SERVICE. No member of the House of Representatives or of the Senate shall draw a salary, pension, or any other monetary benefit upon completion of his term. All members of the House of Representatives and of the Senate shall participate in Social Security and private retirement funds of their choosing. All funds in the current Congressional retirement fund shall move to the Social Security trust fund upon ratification of this amendment.

SECTION 3. DIVESTITURE OF PROGRAMS. Upon ratification of this amendment, the healthcare program of Congress shall be separated from the federal government and formed into a private company. All members of Congress past and present who are participating in the healthcare program shall remain in the program, but the program shall be open to all citizens of the United States under the same terms that members of Congress receive.

# Interregnum (Abolition of "Lame-Duck" Sessions)

_A proposal for an amendment to the Constitution to revise the term of Congress, change the date of elections, and make other changes as needed to prohibit departing Representatives, Senators and the President from taking legislative or executive action during the "lame duck" portion of their terms._

_The dates chosen for the end of the term and the election are based on the Thanksgiving federal holiday, which is set [by law](http:_www.archives.gov/legislative/features/thanksgiving/) as the fourth Thursday of November._

_This amendment overrides parts of the 20th Amendment._

SECTION 1. The term of Congress shall run from the second Monday of January following each even-year federal election to the Friday before the fourth Thursday in November of the next even-numbered year. Congress shall complete all of its business and adjourn by this date.

SECTION 2. On the Tuesday before the fourth Thursday of November, the people shall elect their representatives to the House of Representatives. _[Some states, particularly Louisiana, have election procedures that can result in this election being unresolved. I need to add language to address those situations.]_

SECTION 3. Unless the 17th Amendment is repealed and election of Senators is transferred to the states before the ratification of this amendment, on the Tuesday before the fourth Thursday of November, the people shall elect their Senators as prescribed by this Constitution. If the 17th Amendment is repealed and election of Senators is transferred to the states before the ratification of this amendment, during the first full week of December, the state legislatures shall fill any expired or vacated Senate seats.

SECTION 4. _(Applies only if the Presidential conclave, which is described in another amendment, is implemented.)_ On the first Monday following the fourth Thursday of November, the newly-elected Congress shall convene for the Presidential conclave. All House and Senate members shall take a special oath pertaining only to the selection of the President and Vice-President. Selection of the President and Vice-President shall be the only business conducted by Congress during the conclave. Once Congress selects a President and Vice-President by majority vote of both Houses,  Congress shall adjourn and conduct no other business.

SECTION 5. On the first Monday of January, the new Congress shall convene to conduct the following business:

a) All members shall take the oath of office.

b) New members shall receive orientation and training.

c) New members shall be assigned working space and receive other provisions as needed to fulfill their office.

d) The House and the Senate shall elect leadership and assign members to committees and subcommittees.

e) Members of the House and Senate may introduce legislation.

Congress shall not pass legislation until the beginning of the term of the President as prescribed in Section 6, except in the manner detailed by Section 7 for emergencies.

SECTION 6. The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the second Monday of January.

SECTION 7. EMERGENCY SESSIONS OF CONGRESS. In the event that an emergency situation shall require the action of Congress during the interregnum defined by Sections 1 and 5, the president and states shall be allowed to call an emergency session of Congress by the following process:

a) The President shall issue the call for the emergency session of Congress and explicitly state the nature of the emergency.

b) The governors of the states shall respond to the call with yay or nay. If the yays total two-fifths or more of the states, the session shall be implemented.

c) The Congress of the emergency session shall consist of one Senator from each state, chosen by the governor from the sitting Senators of the state at the time of the emergency (that is, those whose terms have not expired and have not been removed from office by other means). 

d) The Vice-President shall oversee and execute the business of the emergency session.

e) The Congress of the emergency session shall not be required to convene upon the Capitol, but shall conduct its business using whatever means available.

f) The Congress of the emergency session shall consider and pass legislation only that pertains directly to the emergency as defined as the President.

_There surely are more details that are needed, and this section surely is long and detailed enough for its own amendment._

SECTION 8. This amendment overrides Sections 1 and 2 of the 20th Amendment.

An amendment to create a tribunal of the several states for the purpose of enforcing compliance of the United States Constitution.

SECTION 1. The several states shall elect and convene a tribunal of five representatives for the purpose of enforcing compliance with this Constitution. The tribunal shall be tasked with the following tasks:

* Finding the President or members of the House of Representatives or of the Senate in contempt of the Constitution.
* Assessing penalties for such violations and determining the means of imposing those penalties.

SECTION 2. COMPOSITION OF THE TRIBUNAL. To ensure that the tribunal represents the interests of all of the states, the tribunal will have the following requirements:

* No two members of the tribunal shall reside in the same state.
* No member of the tribunal shall reside in the District of Columbia nor in any other territory.
* At least one member of the tribunal shall reside in one of the states that ranks among the bottom quintile in population, as measured by the most recent census (article XX, section XX).

SECTION 3. QUALIFICATION OF MEMBERS. In order to be a member of the tribunal, a person must meet these qualifications:

* Be at least thirty-five years of age.
* Have a permanent residence within one of the several states.
* Have resided within the several states for at least ten consecutive years.
* Have not previously served as President or Vice President or a member of the House of Representatives or the Senate.
* Have not previously served as a member of the tribunal. (Thus, all members of the tribunal shall serve at most one complete term.)

SECTION 4. ELECTION OF MEMBERS. The legislature of each state shall nominate five candidates. The five candidates who receive the most nominations shall be elected to the tribunal. In the event that two or more nominees receive the same number of nominations, the nominee who resides in the least-populous state shall be selected.

SECTION 5. TERM OF SERVICE. The states shall elect the members of tribunal no earlier than the Monday following the election of the President, as established in Article XX Section XX. The elected members of the tribunal shall begin service at the beginning of the term of the President and conclude service at the end of the term. Thus each tribunal shall serve during one term of the President.

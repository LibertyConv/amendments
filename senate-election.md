_Some of the language for this amendment comes from Mark Levin's "An Amendment to Restore the Senate" (The Liberty Amendments). However, the process described by this amendment is largely my own concept._Some

_The general intent of the amendment is to return the Senate to its original role of representing the states. The process described in Section 2 facilitates the process by involving state governors and forcing the legislatures to approve specific candidates by up-or-down votes._

SECTION 1. This amendment supersedes the Seventeenth Amendment. All Senators shall be chosen by their state legislatures as prescribed in this Amendment.

SECTION 2. Each Senator shall be chosen in the following manner:

First, the Governor of the State or Commonwealth shall nominate one person for the office of United States Senator for that state or commonwealth.

Then, each house of the legislative body of the state shall confirm the nominee by majority vote on one ballot.

If one or more legislative bodies of the state shall fail to confirm the nominee by majority vote on one ballot, the candidate shall be disqualified and the process repeated.

All other rules regarding the election and qualification of United States Senators shall remain in place.

SECTION 3. This amendment shall not be so construed as to affect the term of any Senator chosen before it becomes valid as part of the Constitution.

SECTION 4. The process described in Section 2 shall be used to chose Senators both at the normal expiration of terms as prescribed elsewhere in the Constitution, and upon vacancy during the term.

SECTION 5. When vacancies occur in the representation of any State in the Senate within a term, the seat shall remain vacant until filled according to the process of Section 2.

SECTION 6. A Senator may be removed from office by a two-thirds vote of the state Legislature.

# Legislative Override of the Supreme Court

The following amendments come from "An Amendment to Establish Term Limits for Supreme Court Justices and Super-Majority Legislative Overrides" in Mark Levin's _The Liberty Amendments_. Levin's amendment also covers term limits for Supreme Court justices, which I support in a separate amendment. I have also separated this part of Levin's amendment into two separate amendments as I feel they should be ratified separately. I have also created another amendment (not proposed by Levin) preventing the use of nullified opinion as precedent.

## Congressional Override of the Supreme Court

SECTION 1. Upon three-fifths vote of the House of Representatives and the Senate, Congress may override a majority opinion rendered by the Supreme Court.

SECTION 2. The Congressional override under Section 1 is not subject to a Presidential veto and shall not be the subject of litigation or review in any Federal or State court.

SECTION 3. Congressional override authority under Section 1 must be exercised no later than seven hundred and thirty (730) days from the date of the Supreme Court rendering its majority opinion, after which date Congress is prohibited from exercising the override.

## State Override of the Supreme Court

SECTION 1. Upon three-fifths vote of the several state legislatures, the States may override a majority opinion rendered by the Supreme Court.

SECTION 2. The States' override under Section 1 shall not be the subject of litigation or review in any Federal or State court, or oversight or interference by Congress or the President.

SECTION 3. State override authority under Section 1 must be exercised no later than seven hundred and thirty (730) days from the date of the Supreme Court rendering its majority opinion, after which date the States prohibited from exercising the override.

## Nullification of Majority Opinion

SECTION 1. If this Constitution prescribes a method by which the President, Congress, or the States may override or nullify a majority opinion of the Supreme Court, and such override or nullification takes place, neither such overridden or nullified opinion nor any dissenting opinion from the case may be used as precedent for any other Supreme Court ruling. Any such use of a overridden or nullified ruling shall be considered a violation of this Constitution.

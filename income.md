# Definition of Income for the Purpose of Taxation

PREAMBLE. The first problem with any attempt to legislate the taxation of income is defining what constitutes taxable income. Congress is currently free to define "income," or what is exempt from being considered income, in any manner in which it pleases. This amendment provides rules by which Congress shall assess taxation on income. (Note that this amendment does not address any moral or social justice issues associated with such taxation.)

This amendment seeks to remedy the following problems:

1. The federal income tax of the United States has become an incorrigible bureaucracy. It is largely impossible for an individual to comply with the law without assistance from a knowledgeable professional or from software. Preparing taxes consumes billions of dollars and hours which could be put to better use in the economy.
2. The federal government now uses the Internal Revenue Service as a bully force for a number of purposes: to harass and punish opposition groups; to enforce requirements in the Affordable Care Act; _et cetera_.

This amendment defines income for the purpose of taxation, gives Congress the authority to set rates of taxation, and establishes other ground rules over the taxation of income.

SECTION 1. DEFINITION OF INCOME. For the purposes of taxation, the income of an individual or a corporation shall be defined as the sum of the following:

* Gross revenue received for the sale of consumable and durable goods.
* Gross revenue received for the rendering of services.
* Gross revenue received for the disposition of capital assets.
* Dividends received from capital assets.

SECTION 2. Congress shall have no authority to alter the definition of income in Section 1 and define as income any revenue not explicitly defined in Section 1. This shall include all direct transfers of money, goods, services, and capital assets from one individual to another through inheritance or direct donation.

SECTION 3. Congress shall have the discretion to assess taxes on income according to the definition of income in Section 1. If Congress shall exercise this discretion and assess taxes on income, Congress shall assess a flat rate of taxation on each category of income. Congress shall make no law creating any sort of exception from income as defined in Section 1.

SECTION 4. AGENCY OF COLLECTION. If Congress shall exercise the discretion to assess taxes on income, Congress shall establish or designate an agency for the collection of taxes on income. This agency shall enforce the laws enacted by Congress regarding the taxation of income and the collection of such tax in a uniform manner, without preference for or discrimination against any individual or corporation.

SECTION 5. If Congress shall exercise the discretion to assess taxes on income, Congress shall also establish appropriate penalties for failure of an individual or corporation to remit taxes on income as established by Congress or insufficient remission of such taxes.

SECTION 6. Any revenue collected from an individual or corporation in excess of the flat rate established by Congress shall be refunded to the individual or corporation in a manner commensurate with the penalty assessed on failure to pay or underpayment.

SECTION 7. If the agency designated by Congress according to Section 4 shall accuse any individual or corporation of failing to pay taxes according to the rate established by Congress, that individual or corporation shall receive due process according to the Fifth Amendment.
